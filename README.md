## Inspiration

With COVID bringing classrooms online, I have seen the teachers struggle through to get the student to speak up by unmuting the mic or teach to the screen without even being sure about if the student on the other is paying attention. We have also seen scenarios where the students were taking over the control of the classroom and making fun of teachers. I wanted to give back the control of the teacher's back to them.
